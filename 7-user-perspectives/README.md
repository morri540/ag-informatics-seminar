## Overview of the Topic
Population growth, climate change, changing farming practices, and rising affluence has all changed how we perceive agricultural and obtain food on our table. Many of these articles showcase Smart Farming and/or Precision Agriculture and how data can play a part in that journey. The roles and power relations among different players in agricultural and their user perspectives will continue to change current food supply chain networks, import/export of data, and also new challenges and opportunities for farmer all across the world. There continues to be smart agriculture security concerns that will require many professionals in the agricultural industry to make changes in the functionality of smart agriculture to adapt and to continue to support those most in need.
 

## Short Synopsis of Materials, Discussion Question, and Key Takeways 

### Farmer perspectives on ag-tech/data

1. Farmer Perspectives on Data 2021

	o Summary: This article, while only highlighting a small portion of farmers, highlighted some of the barriers that exist that prevent farmers from incorporating data and FMIS into their operations. There are ever changing mentalities around data use in farming and a need for resources at an increased rate and scale needed to meet emerging challenges. Summaries of their survey conveyed that the single biggest issue preventing farmers’ from transitionally digitally in their operations was concerns about how their data will be used and shared. Additionally, there are many challenges of farmers not valuing complicated aspects of the transition. “By amplifying direct farmer benefits of digital transitions, FMIS and digital ag organizations are likely to improve adoption rates by ensuring farmers find value in adoption.”

	o Key Takeaways

		- A focus on 610 farmers that were surveyed about the use of Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) and Digital Sustainability/Conservation Tools

		- FMIS: “any commercially available farm management software suite designed to help farmers collect, store, and use their production data.”

		- Digital Sustainability/Conservation Tools: “any software suite designed to help farmers collect, store, use and report data specifically related to conservation and sustainability”

		- 62% of respondents said they don't rely on Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) exclusively. 

		- 28% of respondents said their primary data storage method is paper or other non-digitized methods

		- 47% of respondents report being entirely satisfied with its outputs while 6% report being entirely dissatisfied

		- 52% of all respondents said they have a trusted advisor who could answer questions related to FMIS and digital ag; 

		- FMIS use rates increase with overall operation size, but usage rates for smaller operations was still significant

		- 79% of respondents stated they would start or increase use of precision farm management technologies if they could acquire the equipment at no charge or incentivized discount.

		- 65% of respondents said their customers do not have a right to know how the crop was produced.

		- “73% of respondents don’t trust private companies with their data, and 58% don’t trust the government with it; conversely, 71% do trust their financial institutions with their data.”

		- “The respondents who primarily market their harvest to a food or fuel company are more likely to use FMIS as compared to respondents who market to other outlets”

	o Questions

		- Are you working with farmers in your research? If yes, how will you combat these concerns around data being used and shared to your farmers? If no, what would be some of your concerns if you were a farmer?

		- The article describes some barriers to change to digital farming, including proximity to retirement or cultural factors, what are some other barriers you can think of?

2. Digital and Data-Driven Agriculture: Harnessing the Power of Data for Smallholders
	
	o	Summary: Small holder farmers often face limited access to resources in agriculture, including resources around digital agriculture. These challenges are particularly critical in developing countries because they lack supporting environmental factors and necessary capacities to implement some of these technologies. Poor rural infrastructure such as internet, cell phone access and road connectivity, markets and capacities all hinder the use and benefit of data-driven agriculture in these communities. The data in any small holder farmer that is shared (exported) by farmers locally and globally should provide ‘win-win’ results and the ‘Imported’ data should be analyzed and adjusted to what farmers need and can handle. Open data, if applied flatly can undermine a farmers’ livelihoods and there are growing concerns to safeguard the data streams for farmers to ensure it is not exploited at cost to the farmer. “For smallholder farmers to benefit and overcome these challenges, must aim at symmetry, balance and equity in the data flow …. This can be achieved through supporting institutions and structures such as policies, legislation, regulations and regulatory mechanisms.”

3. Farmers and their data: An examination of farmers’ reluctance to share their data through the lens of the laws impacting smart farming

	o	Summary: Some farmers are reluctant about switching practices because of “moral and ethical questions about access, cost, scale and support” while other challenges relate to “farm data ownership, privacy, cybersecurity and the equitable sharing of the benefits of digitization and data collection.” Some of the major challenges, which is seemingly across many agricultural industrial, is a lack of trust in data protection. This is in part due to the “click wrap” ideology that is in many agreements for technologies, and other ‘take it or leave it’ basis in digital agriculture. “Currently, farmers feel that they bear too much of the risk and vulnerability, and do not benefit from the rewards that smart farming brings.”

	o	Key Takeaways

		-	Survey of 1000 producers across 17 industries

		-	74% of respondents did not know much about the terms and conditions relating to data collection

		-	24% of respondents indicated they were comfortable or extremely comfortable with data collection services/technology

		-	56% of the respondents displayed no trust at all to little trust in service/technology providers maintaining the privacy of their data

	o	Questions:

		-	There are may papers that express a lack of trust on part of the farmers in data protection, what can you do in your research to enhance trust?

		-	How could you increase transparency about the terms of use in data licenses?

### An overview of trust issues in agriculture

4. Cultivating trust in technology-mediated sustainable agricultural research

	o	Summary: Precision Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) can be thought of as a team science approach that is operationalized through a series of social and technical infrastructures of data acquisition protocols and tools. The aim of many of these methods is to promote transparency and accountability within the expensive networks of digital agriculture. Some of the important areas of focus includes increasing crop productivity, profitability, and resilience, conserve soil and water resources. There are commendations on how to build trust among data stakeholders they do not provide guidance on how to “operationalize trust via social and technical infrastructure.” This challenge encompasses and will continue to include structural data protection in the present while anticipating emergent opportunities for data use in the future.
	
	o	Key Takeaways

		-	Core Ideas of PSA

			•	Sustainable agriculture is information intensive, requiring data sharing among many actors.

			•	Trust can be mediated through technology, but only with the input of all data stakeholders.

			•	Practicing privacy preserving strategies and increasing stakeholder agency increase trust.

			•	Transparency and accountability can aid in fostering trust in the process of data management.

			•	Cultivating trust is critical for success in data-driven and sustainable agriculture.

		-	Translating trust into a technical infrastructure

			•	Project governance

			•	Stakeholder engagement

			•	The open-source way of development

			•	A maturity model to govern data acquisition

			•	Handling data with varying sensitivity

			•	Managing and anticipating data use potentialities

	o	Questions

		-	“The Pew report identified two key factors that engender greater public trust in scientific findings: open availability of data to the public and review of scientific data by independent committees.” How can open availability and review by independent committees be brought into agricultural data research?

		-	The article illustrates 6 ways of “Translating trust into a technical infrastructure.” For your research, what would be the most effective way to instill trust from your participants or your stakeholders?

		-	Ag data can be categorized using the image in section 4.5 (FIGURE 4). Do you agree with this classification and where does your data fall into this sensitivity level?

			•	Handling data with varying sensitivity

### Role of open source in agriculture

5.Ag’s Future Belongs to Open Source

	o	Summary: Innovation in agricultural is an evolutionary process, but it seems that the more compelling part of open-source data movement is that the tech industry found more profit in combinations of open source and proprietary development that in proprietary development of their data. Open Ag Technology Systems (OATS) at Purdue as an industry partner to create an open-source community in agriculture through projects, education, collaboration, and communication. They are convinced that open source can bring better and new intuitive ways into agriculture.

	o	Questions

		-	The article claims that the open-source paradigm in agriculture research enables researchers to "... start with the actual work-the actual code, the actual test cases, and even the actual data," rather than a "vaguely described algorithm" or methodology. Where have you encountered this frustration in your field? Are there any potential downsides/concerns to open-source code in agriculture research?

		-	The article highlights that open source can help attract talent in agriculture research and industry by creating a "culture of discovery in our companies and our universities" that contrasts what we get when we "[keep] our ideas secret." How does your field encourage this level of sharing already, if at all? How might current research and publishing trends need to adapt to encourage this culture?
